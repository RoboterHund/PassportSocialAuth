Passport + MongoDB
==================
&copy; 2014 RoboterHund

I wrote this to try out the `passport` authentication module.

The only missing part is the `private` folder, which is supposed to be private.
But I pushed the `private_view` folder instead, which is the same thing, but with the parts I did not want to publish replaced with `THE_*(something)`.
